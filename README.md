# Athena Appetite (Temporary Name)
## Product Proposal
### Vision 

Our restaurant finder/generator website will be using a database comprises of restaurants information and reviews from Google and Yelp to recommend to a customer where they would like to eat. 

Our targeted audience and user personas that we aim at are customers looking for a restaurant to eat and the restaurant owners in Cincinnati.

Whenever we want to find places to eat, we would need to go through Google Map, Yelp and various online platforms to search for a restaurant. However, with the use of website, we think that finding a restaurant should be an experience not a chore. For now, our product will be name Athena, but later on we will decide an official name for it. 

For the moment, our competitors like Yelp, Google and Tripadvisor also have restaurant suggestion features. They would be our primary competitors.

We would like our website to focus only on restaurant suggesting and reviewing of dishes. For whatever your preferences maybe, we will find a restaurant that matches one's preference. For now, we imagine it to have a user interface like Tinder, however, it is for food. The description for the restaurant will either be generated through the databases or restaurant owners could register with us to make their profile looks better.
